# The Taxonomy of Terror
An NLP-centered project for capstone 2 of the Galvanize Data Science Intensive.

## Unsupervised Approach:

1: Build a pipeline to efficiently prepare the texts for topic modeling
2: Extract latent topics from the texts
3: Summarize those topics
4: Find the best number of topics to use for the model automatically, using NMF
5: Find the highest quality topics among all the topics
6: Predict the topic of a new short story

## Supervised Approach: 
Kaggle competition using these texts as predictors of the author. The target would be the author and the goal is to train a model that can identify the author of an unseen piece of text, out of three authors whose work is included in the corpus.
